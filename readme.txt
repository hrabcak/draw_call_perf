If you want to compile async_vbo_transfers examples by yourself
you will need GLM math library.

For those users which have instaled GIT there are
prepared scripts get_glm.sh/get_glm.bat that download GLM repository
into ./etx/ogl-math folder.

GLM git url:
git://ogl-math.git.sourceforge.net/gitroot/ogl-math/ogl-math

Otherwise you have to download GLM library by yourself from here 
http://glm.g-truc.net/ and unpack it to ./ext/ogl-math folder.

All examples were prepared with GLM version 0.9.2.6.
